Setups:
Two testing devices are both on Android 4.0 (ICS). Therefore API level 14, 15
can be used, but not 16 and 17.

Developers need to download Android SDK and put 'android-sdk-linux' directory
under 'DigitalStickyNotes' directory, and install Eclipse ADT.

1. Rooms detection:
    a. Bluetooth: range is ideal, but asking users to always turn on the
    bluetooth is not a good thing.
    b. Wifi: can't determine location at all.
    c. Radio signal: always need to plug in earphones as antenna.
    d. Using latitude, longitude, and magnetic field pattern.
    e. Android 4.0 or higher allows for wirelessly connecting devices that
    are physically nearby, using WIFI Direct technology. However this
    solution could be expensive, because we need a WIFI Direct access point
    in each room.
