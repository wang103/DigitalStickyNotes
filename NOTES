1. Rooms detection:
    a. Bluetooth: range is ideal, but asking users to always turn on the
    bluetooth is not a good thing.
    b. Wifi: can't determine location at all.
    c. Radio signal: always need to plug in earphones as antenna.
    d. Using latitude, longitude, and magnetic field pattern.
    e. Android 4.1 or higher allows for wirelessly connecting devices that
    are physically nearby.
