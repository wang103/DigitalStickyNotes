Setups:
Currently in need of two Android 4.1 (JB) devices for testing. Android 4.0 (ICS)
does not support WIFI and WIFI Direct concurrency.

ICS can use API levels 14, 15.
JB can use API levels 16, 17.

Developers need to download Android SDK and put 'android-sdk-linux' directory
under 'DigitalStickyNotes' directory, and install Eclipse ADT.

1. Rooms detection:
    a. Bluetooth: range is ideal, but asking users to always turn on the
    bluetooth is not a good thing.
    b. Wifi: can't determine location at all.
    c. Radio signal: always need to plug in earphones as antenna.
    d. Using latitude, longitude, and magnetic field pattern.
    e. Android 4.0 or higher allows for wirelessly connecting devices that
    are physically nearby, using WIFI Direct technology. However this
    solution could be expensive, because we need a WIFI Direct access point
    in each room.

BlueCove-2.1.0 is used as BlueTooth library for the server side.
bluez-libs must be installed for Linux systems.

urlAddress in class Communicator should points to the actual address of the
server hosting PHP/handle_requests.php.
