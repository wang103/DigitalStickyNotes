Predictive Indoor Navigation using Commercial Smart-phones

Uses dead reckoning and Wifi signal strength fingerprinting.
(can try using dead reckoning, whenever passing by a WIFI Direct station,
update the location. Dead reckoning needs accelerometer, magnetometer, and
gyroscope sensors)

GSM signal strengths can be used to accurately determine which floor of a
building the user is in.
(May not need this if WIFI Direct signal range is just right)
