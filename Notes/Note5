Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is best suited for key in mobile computing.
160 bits equivalent in strength to RSA of 1024 bits.

ECAKA protocol presented in this paper requires pre-shared secret key, so it's
not suitable for this project.

To achieve authenticated key agreement protocol with identity authentication:
1. Station-to-station protocol.
2. A Elliptic Curve Cryptography based AKA for wireless communication using
Public-Key infrastructure.
