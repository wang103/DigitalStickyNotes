User is identified by his/her phone.

Server's location could be an uncertainty when it's mobile instead of
stationary:
Automatically disable the server when user of the phone leaves the building or
changes his/her currently location dramatically.

Notes themselves are stored in mobile servers and central server.

These need to be controlled by a central server:
Each user would have a trused servers list (User trusts the server to represent
the correct location).
Each user would have a known clients list (User allows those clients to leave
notes for them).
