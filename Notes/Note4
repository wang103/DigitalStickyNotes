Use Exponential backoff algorithm during peer connections.

Similar to SMS Center, have a central server to hold some notes until the
destination 'server' devices is available.
Central server encrypts the message with receiver's public key before sending
it to the 'server' device. If 'server' device's buffer is full, a new note
will always replace an old one.

Authentication of sender and receiver can be confirmed using public private
key algorithm. Every user's public keys are stored on central server using
registration.

In addition to encryption, compression can also be used.

Sender needs to know receivers' public keys, if doesn't, the message is sent to
the central server instead. In this case, internet connection is required. After
this, receivers' keys will be cached in sender's cache file so next time, if
server device is connected, central server can be by passed.

User can set cache size:
public keys cache
other users' compressed, encrypted messages cache
group information cache

This paper shows characteristics of some encryption and compression algorithms,
(RSA, Elliptic Curve, Huffman Encoding, SHannon Fano) might be useful.
